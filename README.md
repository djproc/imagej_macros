useful imagej macros for microscopists

I've created this repository to store the macors i use regulalry and track their changes.

These macros are particularly useful for people working with metamorph who want to use imagej to open datasets and perform analysis. 

Description:

LinescanonfolderMACRO_WORKING
This will perform a 150px wide linescan on all coordinates in csv files in one folder.

Loadmetamorphtimelapse_fromcsv_twocolor_merged_WORKING
This will take data from an mda file in metamorph and load it in imagej, making a two color merged file

drawarrowontimelapse_fromtrackmatedata
If you use manual tracking software (in imagej) you can export this csv and then use this macro to draw an arrow right next to the thing you're tracking
